# CS216
Files from my CS216 class that I attended at Saginaw Valley State University. Some of the topics are:
* Object Oriented Programming
* Hashing & Double Hashing
* Different types of searches
* Linked lists & pointers in general

All of these files are free to be used for whatever you like as long as you do not claim them as your own.
You can visit [my website](http://elijahwilson.me) for more of my projects.
